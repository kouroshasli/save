Because I need to save the webp image on the chrome web store as jpg format, I first found a special conversion software, but it was more troublesome to use, and then found a Save Image As Type 1.0.5 extension in the web store, but this extension has not been maintained for a long time, and it is currently **inoperable**, so I made some improvements on this basis.

[Install Save Image as Type from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gabfmnliflodkdafenbcpjdlppllnemd)

Reference works 1: ~~Save Image As Type 1.0.5~~ (Removed from web store)

Reference works 2: [Save Image As PNG 1.0.2](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nkokmeaibnajheohncaamjggkanfbphi)
(Can only be saved as PNGï¼ŒCannot be saved as JPG and WebP)
